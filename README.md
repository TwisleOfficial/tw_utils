# 📝 tw_utils

### 🧠 About
Just a bunch of boilerplate exports that I use in all of my scripts done I a way that I like. I just rather write a resource myself for something then use someone elses. Feel free to use this in your resources.
If you are here for common used things please check the files for what your looking for there should be tables in there.
For example, animations > animations.lua has a table called commonAnims.

### 🖥️ Install
Put it in your resource folder and make sure to ensure this script before anything that uses it.

### ⬆️ Exports
