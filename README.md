# 📝 tw_utils

### 🧠 About
Just a bunch of boilerplate exports that I use in all of my scripts done I a way that I like. I just rather write a resource myself for something then use someone elses. Feel free to use this in your resources.

### 🖥️ Install
Put it in your resource folder and make sure to ensure this script before anything that uses it.

### ⬆️ Exports
Client Exports
```
	exports.tw_utils:loadAnimDict(dict)
